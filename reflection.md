## Reflection Document

### HTML

#### 1.Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I was able to complete the exercises, but I had few doubts, so I went through the modules and got them cleared.

#### 2.How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

The exercises in this section were very helpful, we got to learn some basics of HTML. And exercise 3 was very helpful, where we need to create a table using html, which I did it for the first time.

#### 3.Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I wish we had some more explanation about the difference between ordered and unordered lists, specifically when and where we should use each one of them. Also, a bit more detail on form validation would have been great.

#### 4.Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

Few extra exercises on the semantic tags might helped me a bit more, as there are many other semangtic elements in HTML, practicing them would be great.

### Accessibility

#### 1.Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I have completed the exercise on my own, exercise 1 and homework 1 made this exercise a bit easy to complete.

#### 2.How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

This exercise was helpful in understanding how to make forms more accessible by using labels, fieldsets, legends, and semantic tags, to reduce the accessibility issues and errors.

#### 3.Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

If there was a little more explanation about how semantic HTML elements like main, fieldset, and legend, like how will they support accessibility through ARIA roles wolud have been helpful.

#### 4.Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

In this week we had only one exercise, a few more exercises on accessibility would have been better.
